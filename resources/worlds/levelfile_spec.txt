The following specifies the .lvl format.

// the start of the file begins with the width and height
// in 'block' units, these are the building blocks of a level.
<w> <h>

// Next is an array making up the interior of the level
// The array consists of the following:

// R 	- Red breakable block (requires 4 hits to break)
// O 	- Orange breakable block (requires 3 hits to break)
// Y 	- Yellow breakable block (requires 2 hits to break)
// G 	- Green breakable block (requires 1 hit to break)
// B 	- Bomb
// S 	- A solid unbreakable block
// E 	- Empty spot

// T(x,p) - Triangle block: 
// x: type of block from the above, can be any of the following: {R, O, Y, G, S}
// p: the orientation of the triangle (where the outer corner is located), can be any of the following: {ul, ur, ll, lr}
// i.e., upper-left = ul, lower-right = lr, etc.

// I - Ink block   (If hit it splats all over the player's vision)
// P - Prism block (Unbreakable, but if hit by any sort of laser it reflects/refracts the laser)
