The following specifies the .lvl format.

// The start of the file begins with the level name
<level_name>

// The next element is the width and height
// in 'block' units, these are the building blocks of a level.
<w> <h>

// Next is an array making up the interior of the level
// The array consists of the following:

// R - Red breakable block (requires 4 hits to break)
// O - Orange breakable block (requires 3 hits to break)
// Y - Yellow breakable block (requires 2 hits to break)
// G - Green breakable block (requires 1 hit to break)
// B - Bomb block
// S - A solid unbreakable block
// E - Empty spot
// I - Ink block   (When hit it splats all over the player's vision)
// P - Prism block (Unbreakable, but if hit by any sort of laser it reflects/refracts the laser)
// L - Collateral block (when hit it falls downwards destroying almost everything in its path)

// C(d) - Cannon block
// d: The direction to always fire the cannon block in (or specify random firing direction)
//    the value can be any degree angle starting at 0 going to 359, the special value of -1 can be used
//    to specify a random direction. The angle starts by firing directly upwards and moves around the circle
// of angles clockwise (e.g., 90 will always fire the ball perfectly to the right of the cannon, 180 will always
// fire the ball downwards from the cannon, ...).

// T(x,p) - Triangle block: 
// x: type of block from the above, can be any of the following: {R, O, Y, G, S, P}
// p: the orientation of the triangle (where the outer corner is located), can be any of the following: {ul, ur, ll, lr}
// i.e., upper-left = ul, lower-right = lr, etc.

// X(a,b) - Portal block:
// a: A single character name for this portal block
// b: The single character name of the sibling portal block that this portal block is
// the enterence and exit for.

// A([1|0], [1|0], a, b) - Tesla Block (When active with another tesla block, forms an arc of lightning between the two)
// [1|0]: A '1' or a '0' to indicated whether it starts on (1) or off (0).
// [1|0]: A '1' or a '0' to indicated whether it can be turned on/off (1) or is unchangable (0).
// a : The single character name of this tesla block.
// b : One or more other named tesla blocks seperated by commas.

// D(i0, i1, i2, ...) - Item drop block:
// i0, i1, i2, ... : The names of all the item types that the block is allowed to drop, names can be 
//                   repeated in order to make higher probabilities of drops. Also, there are several special key
//                   words that can be used: (all, powerups, powerdowns, powerneutrals), which cause the block to drop 
//                   all items of those respective designations.

// W(a) - Switch block:
// a : The trigger ID of the block that gets triggered by the switch 
//     (switch is turned on when a ball/projectile hits it).

// NOTE: All blocks may have an optional trigger ID, which must be a 0 or positive integer 
// contained within curly brackets at the end of the block signature.
// e.g., R{12}, X(z,j){1}, ...

// F(a) - One-way block:
// a : The direction that the block allows the ball to travel through it, allowable options are:
//     {u, d, l, r} for up, down, left and right, respectively.

<block list in order of top-left to bottom-right>

// After the blocks are enumerated, the star milestone totals
// are declared, they begin with the keyword "STARS:" and 5 values
// are then listed, each on a newline. The values listed correspond to
// the number of points required to get that star starting with the first
// listed line.

STARS:
<point_milestone_for_star_1>
<point_milestone_for_star_2>
<point_milestone_for_star_3>
<point_milestone_for_star_4>
<point_milestone_for_star_5>


// The final set of values are a listing of the various items and a
// number that defines their probability/likelihood of being dropped
// in the level. There are several options here - each item may be
// listed seperately with its item name and a number
// e.g., "PaddleGrow 2"
//
// In this case the number is from 0 to 2, where 0 has no likelihood of
// dropping and 2 is most likely.
//
// The keywords "all", "powerups", "powerneutrals" and "powerdowns"
// may also be used along with a number to signify all of those item types.
