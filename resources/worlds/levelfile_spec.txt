The following specifies the .lvl format.

// The start of the file begins with the level name
<level_name>

// The next element is the width and height
// in 'block' units, these are the building blocks of a level.
<w> <h>

// Next is an array making up the interior of the level
// The array consists of the following:

// R - Red breakable block (requires 4 hits to break)
// O - Orange breakable block (requires 3 hits to break)
// Y - Yellow breakable block (requires 2 hits to break)
// G - Green breakable block (requires 1 hit to break)
// B - Bomb block
// S - A solid unbreakable block
// E - Empty spot
// I - Ink block   (When hit it splats all over the player's vision)
// P - Prism block (Unbreakable, but if hit by any sort of laser it reflects/refracts the laser)
// C - Cannon block
// L - Collateral block (when hit it falls downwards destroying almost everything in its path)

// T(x,p) - Triangle block: 
// x: type of block from the above, can be any of the following: {R, O, Y, G, S, P}
// p: the orientation of the triangle (where the outer corner is located), can be any of the following: {ul, ur, ll, lr}
// i.e., upper-left = ul, lower-right = lr, etc.

// X(a,b) - Portal block:
// a: A single character name for this portal block
// b: The single character name of the sibling portal block that this portal block is
// the enterence and exit for.

// A([1|0], a, B) - Tesla Block (When active with another tesla block, forms an arc of lightning between the two)
// [1|0]: A '1' or a '0' to indicated whether it starts on (1) or off (0).
// a : The single character name of this tesla block.
// B : One or more other named tesla blocks seperated by commas.

// D(i0, i1, i2, ...) - Item drop block:
// i0, i1, i2, ... : The names of all the item types that the block is allowed to drop, names can be 
//                   repeated in order to make higher probabilities of drops. Also, there are several special key
//                   words that can be used: (all, powerups, powerdowns, powerneutrals), which cause the block to drop 
//                   all items of those respective designations.
